# DCS-World-Lua-resources
A collection of Lua functions methods classes and frameworks for specifically for DCS World but some are good pure Lua resouces outside of DCS too

This is a public (yet not advertised) repository and if you've stumbled across it then kudos, please feel free to use the resouce as you see fit.

I am the developer of the DCS XSAF server, I'm working in the background with ED to bring some further knowledge to the community around advanced implementation and usage of Lua with DCS and this is a WIP placeholder repo at the moment.

If you like what you see here please leave a message in 'issues', likewise if you have issues do the same, or indeed if you can think of a problem I can help you with.

Code in here may be untested, require tweaking and assumes you have a basic to good working knowledge of Lua to implement however, the solutions will be specific DCS, out of the box thinking and hopefully will be high performing and unique.

I may or may not provide support in this early stage.
